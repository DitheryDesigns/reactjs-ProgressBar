# ProgressBar Component

## Overview
The `ProgressBar` component visually represents progress towards a completion goal. The component is fully customizable and responds dynamically to changes in progress, making it suitable for a wide range of applications requiring visual progress indicators.

## Features
- **Dynamic Progress Update**: The progress bar updates in real-time as the progress value changes.
- **Customizable Width**: The width of the progress bar dynamically adjusts based on the progress percentage.
- **Inline Display of Progress**: The progress percentage is displayed directly on the bar for clear, at-a-glance viewing.

## Installation
To use the `ProgressBar` component in your project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have React and its dependencies installed.
2. Copy the `ProgressBar.js` and `ProgressBar.css` files into your project.
3. Import the `ProgressBar` component where you need to use it:

```javascript
import ProgressBar from './path_to/ProgressBar';
```

## Usage
You can integrate the `ProgressBar` component into your application as follows:

```javascript
<ProgressBar progress={progressValue} />
```

- `progressValue` should be a state or prop that updates based on the logic of your application's progress.

## Styling
The progress bar can be styled by modifying the `ProgressBar.css` file. The default styles can be overridden by more specific CSS rules or inline styles as required by your application.

## Example
Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the `ProgressBar` in a React component:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import ProgressBar from './ProgressBar';

const ExampleComponent = () => {
    const [progress, setProgress] = useState(0);

    useEffect(() => {
        const interval = setInterval(() => {
            setProgress(oldProgress => {
                if (oldProgress >= 100) {
                    clearInterval(interval);
                    return 100;
                }
                return Math.min(oldProgress + 10, 100);
            });
        }, 1000);

        return () => clearInterval(interval);
    }, []);

    return <ProgressBar progress={progress} />;
};

export default ExampleComponent;
```
